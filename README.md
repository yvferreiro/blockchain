# blockchain
Welcome to Yolanda and Liam's project for the Foundations of Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts (CDSCV1001E) class. Here, we upload the files containing the chaincode that needs to be executed (to run our smart contract) and the fabcar folder which consists of the scripts that can be used to add or query data. These functions were defined in our smart contract within the chaincode (called Diamond). 
All the materials written are in Javascript.
